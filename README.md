### 🔗 Link-Lab: Graph-Based Recommendation System

**Link-Lab** is a **graph-based recommendation system** developed as part of our **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** end-semester project.. It’s designed to recommend **movies and other products** by modeling relationships between users, items, and preferences as a **graph network**.

#### 🧩 Key Features

* **Graph-Driven Recommendations:** Uses graph traversal and similarity measures to generate intelligent suggestions across multiple domains (e.g., movies, products, etc.).
* **Efficient DSA Implementation:** Core recommendation logic built using fundamental data structures — graphs, heaps, hash maps, and trees.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to easily extend for new datasets and recommendation types.
* **Visualization Support:** Displays relationships and recommendation paths through interactive or visual graph components.

#### 🧠 Technical Highlights

* **Languages:** *C++
* **Algorithms:** *BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s algorithm, PageRank-style ranking, collaborative filtering concepts*
* **Core Idea:** Represent users and items as nodes in a graph, and generate recommendations by exploring their connections and similarities.

#### 🎓 Project Context

Developed as a **DSA end-semester project** to demonstrate the real-world application of data structures and algorithms in building intelligent and efficient recommendation systems.
